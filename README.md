# Liara Forth, an "initial" ANSI(ish) Forth for the W65C265SXB (65816 CPU)

Liara Forth is a (mostly) ANSI-compliant Forth for the W65C265SXB ("265SXB")
single-board computer that will work with out of the box as a "first Forth".

The 265SXB is an engineering development board -- roughly like the Raspberry Pi
-- produced by the Western Design Center (WDC). It is based on the W65C265S
microcontroler, which in turn has a 65816 microprocessor (MPU) at its core, the
8/16-bit hybrid "big sibling" of the famous 6502 MPU that powered classic
computers such as the VIC-20 and Apple II. The 265SXB is one of the easiest
ways to get started with a 65816 system.

This project is currently in the PRE-ALPHA stage. Pre-ALPHA means that "it
should assemble, but it won't run too well". See the Initial Design Manifest in
the docs folder for details. There is further information in docs/MANUAL.md as
well.

There is a discussion thread for Liara Forth [at
6502.org](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3649).
