Liara Forth is provided on an "as is" basis without any warranty of any kind,
including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose and their equivalents under the laws of any
jurisdiction. Put briefly, use this at your own risk.  

Forth has a long tradition of being placed in the public domain. Liara Forth
continues this. Where external code was used, it was either from the public
domain as well, or it is in separate files with their own license included. See
the source code for documentation of individual routines.
