Proposed memory map for Liara Forth

Liara Forth was written to run on the 265SXB "out of the box, with extras",
which means a Flash memory chip installed in the socket (see
https://github.com/scotws/265SXB-Guide/blob/master/flash.md for details). 

Liara Forth completely avoids the Direct Page (DP) and Stack (S) areas used by
the Mensch Machine monitor in 00:0000 and 00:0100. 

The DP for single-task mode starts at 00:0200; S goes from 00:7f00 00:7fff. 
There is one 1k of buffers for I/O and other temporary mass storage from 
00:7c00 to 00:7eff. 

Input Buffer 1: 00:7c00-7cff
Input Buffer 2: 00:7d00-7dff

For multi-task mode, Liara Forth reserves one 1k-segment for stacks and one 2k-segment for direct pages: 

00:7000 to 00:73ff      S regions (for Return Stack)
00:7400 to 00:7bff      DP regions (for Data Stack)

For each of the up to 16 tasks, this provides 64 bytes of S (for the Return
Stacks), and 128 bytes for DP segments for variables and the Data Stack.
