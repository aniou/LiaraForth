- Code COLON and SEMICOLON, followed by POSTPONE, IMMEDIATE, COMPILE-ONLY, [, ] 
  and :NONAME
- Code math routines required to input and output numbers of any base
- Move all single PUT_CHR calls to EMIT (allows PAUSE later)
- Move all single GET_CHR calls to vectored KEY (allows PAUSE later)
- Decide which words should be high-level
- CLI words: Make sure BS doesn't end up on previous line


TODO LATER (next on top)

- Code vt100 support

- Code multitasking support with PAUSE etc
- Add real multi-line history
