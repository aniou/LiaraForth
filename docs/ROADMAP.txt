TODO NEXT (next on top)

- CLI words: Make sure BS doesn't end up on previous line, add PAGE etc.
- Code math routines required to input and output numbers of any base
- Code CREATE, CONSTANT, and VARIABLE to force check of Dictionary design
- Move all single PUT_CHR calls to EMIT (allows PAUSE later)
- Code EVALUATE to be able to add high-level words
- Move all single GET_CHR calls to vectored KEY (allows PAUSE later)
- Decide which words should be high-level
- Code dual-buffer entry so last used word can be recovered with CTRL-p
- Write validation program for Dictionary in Forth or Python


TODO LATER (next on top)

- Code vt100 support
- Create series of drawings of stack antics in INTERNALS.md
