Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
First version: 02. Dez 2016
This version: 22. Feb 2017


TODO NEXT (next on top)

- Code :NONAME, MARKER, LATESTXT, LATESTNT, WORD-SIZE
- Move string_to_lowercase to FIND-NAME
- CLI handling: Make sure BS doesn't end up on previous line, add CTRL-p, CTRL-n
- Move all single PUT_CHR calls to EMIT (allows PAUSE later)
- Move all single GET_CHR calls to vectored KEY (allows PAUSE later)


TODO LATER (next on top)

- Code multitasking support with PAUSE etc
- Code vt100 support
- Create drawings of stack antics in INTERNALS.md 
- Add real multi-line history
- Consider morse code output because that would be cool
- Add better version of UM* and other multiple/division routines based on tables


FINISHED (newest on top, with date if possible)
 
- Code >NUMBER, NUMBER and CHAR>NUMBER as input routines. Main interpreter loop is now
  complete (22 Feb 2017)
- Code math routines required to output numbers of any base via U. etc (19. Feb 2017)
- Coded comparisons (= and friends) as well as the basic multiplication routines (18. Feb 2017)
- Coded DOES>, POSTPONE, SLITERAL, S", ." as well as IF and THEN, AGAIN, BEGIN, ELSE  (17. Feb 2017)
- Coded [CHAR] which gives us an alternate version of .( (17. Feb 2017)
- Coded LITERAL and the cmpl_ routines (16. Feb 2017)
- Coded C!, C, and C@ (16. Feb 2017)
- Coded COLON and SEMICOLON, followed by POSTPONE, IMMEDIATE, COMPILE-ONLY, [, ] (15. Feb 2017)
- Coded BASE, DECIMAL, HEX, BINARY to prepare for number conversion (15. Feb 2017)
- Coded AND, OR, XOR, NEGATE, INVERT, MAX and MIN (14. Feb 2017)
- Coded CREATE, CONSTANT, and VARIABLE to force check of Dictionary design. This implies 
  DOVAR, DOCONST. Also coded ? while we're at it (14. Feb 2017)
- Renamed a_word -> xt_word, h_word -> nt_word; leave z_word; changed tools accordingly
- Added temporary version of DUMP for testing (13. Feb 2016)
- Added HERE and ALLOT, figure out where CP starts (7. Feb 2016)
- Coded EVALUATE to be able to add high-level words
- Added temporary versions of .S, . (DOT) and DEPTH for debugging
- Code EXECUTE to complete basic loop
- Code FIND-NAME and FIND for basic Dictionary search
- Code basic editing of command line in ACCEPT (CTRL-H, etc)
- Milestone: Test on 265SXB after rewriting Tinkasms
- Added WORDS to validate Dictionary structure (02. Jan 2016)
- Code PARSE-NAME and PARSE for basic parsing (31. Dec 2016)
- Code ACCEPT and REFILL (29. Dec 2016)
- Test keyboard echo on real 265SXB, add entry to manual on how to upload
- Echo keyboard entries (temporary loop) 
- Print intro text (tests access to Mensch Monitor)
- Define constants
