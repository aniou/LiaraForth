Liara Forth can either place the first entry in the Forth Data Stack (the "Top of Stack", TOS) in Direct Page (DP), in register Y (X is used for the Data Stack Pointer, DSP), or the accumulator A. The following is a comparison of common, native-coded ("primitive") Forth words for each of these scenarios. For a summary, see the table at tos_variants. Numbers after the code are size in bytes and speed in cycles.
