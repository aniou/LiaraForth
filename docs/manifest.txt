Liara Forth is a project to create a bare-metal ANSI(ish) Forth specifically for
the W65C265SXB ("265SXB") single-board computer from WDC based on the 65816
8/16-bit hybrid CPU. It is designed to be the "intial" or "first Forth" that
users can install immediately after buying the board and some Flash memory. In
its first form, it uses the Mensch Monitor routines as a basis, and is started
from the Monitor. Later, these routines may be replaced by a alternate monitor
that uses the same calls.


TECHNICAL DETAILS

- 16 bit cell size, subroutine threaded model
- Single user, aim for cooperative round-robin multitasking
- Max 24 Kb size, priorty is speed over size (within reason)
- Dictionary keeps headers and code separate to allow fall-through 
- All code in Bank 0, though tools provided to access other banks
- Return Stack is the system stack. It starts at 03FF and grows "down" 
  (towards 0000). The RSP points to the next free entry.
- Direct Page starts at 0200 and grows "up" (towards FFFF). The DSP points to
  the current top entry, not the next one. 
- The system includes code to write to Flash memory, an editor, and XMODEM
  protocol.


DICTIONARY STRUCTURE

Dictionary header entries are kept separately from the actual code. 

               8bit     8bit
 h_word ->  +--------+--------+
            | Status | Length |
         +2 +--------+--------+
            | Start of Code   | -> s_word 
         +4 +-----------------+
            | End of Code     | -> e_word
         +6 +-----------------+
            | Next Header     | -> h_word2
         +8 +--------+--------+
            | Name   |        |
            +--------+--------+
            |        |        |
            +--------+--------+
            |        |  ...   |
         +n +--------+--------+

Each header consists of a Status Byte (see below), a Length Byte - words can be
up to 265 characters long, a 16-bit pointer to the start of the actual code, a
16-bit pointer to the end of the actual code (used for compilation of words),
followed by the name string. The name string is not terminated by a zero. 

The Status Byte contains three flags:
    - Native (N) - if true, the word is a machine language primtive
    - Compiled (C) - if true, the word is compiled into new words
    - Immediate (I) - if true, word is immediately executed during compilation
